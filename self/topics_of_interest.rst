Topics of Interest
==================


This document will contain the topics I'm interested in learning and resources that are available.

This is being stored under version control system so that I can track my progress and look back later on about how it went. Earlier I was using Wunderlist to keep note of these things but it was clumsy and not well suited with storing data about each goal.



C Language
----------

I want to get a good grasp of C since many other softwares I deal with are written in it and I want to be able to play with their code. Also I like to go deeper into a system (including OS, programming languages and softwares implemented in C) and understand how it is implemented.

**Resources**

- Kerninghan and Ritchie's book. I started with it but by midway I found it to be too dense and cryptic at times. So I decided to pick some other book with explains things in details.
- Programming in C by Stephen G. Kochan. I'm almost done with the book and know about the basics of C.
- `Beej's Guide to Network Programming`_ explains low level networking stuff in C. I need to practice what I have learned about C, so what can be a better way to practice C than to learn another topic that I'm deeply interested in it.
- `The Hardware/Software Interface`_ MOOC. I got into C via this course. I started it, completed 2-3 weeks worth of material but since I didn't know anything about C, I felt lost at times. So I decided to stop doing that course and learn C first. I will get back to it after a while.

Objective C Language
--------------------

I primarily use Mac OS and being a programmer, it is natural for me to be interested in developing for the operating system. Also, since I already have got the basics of C, getting into Obj C shouldn't be a problem. I have also got some ideas for apps so I shouldn't avoid learning this.

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4118656/how-long-did-it-take-you-to-learn-objective-c-probably
- `Programming in Objective-C`_ by Stephen G. Kochan. I should get this book.
- `Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide`_ by Aaron Hillegass. This books sounds good as well.



Data Structures and Algorightms
-------------------------------

I know a bit about algorithms (mostly those search and sort ones) and almost nothing about data structures. I keep hearing from people that this is an important topic in CS and also this is included in undergrad syllabus for most of the institutions, I'm going to cover this.

- http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/video-lectures/
- `Introduction to Algorithms`_ - This book seems to be the standard everywhere and also this book is prescribed in the MIT's lectures so I already bought it.
- http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693 This book is also recommended by many people including tptacek.



Statistics
----------

Graphs keeps popping up time and again and I feel ashamed with not being able to understand anything but simple bar graphs. So much of the data is analyzed and presented with the help of statistics and I feel that I should have a good understanding of this subject.

- https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-3x/introduction-statistics/825
